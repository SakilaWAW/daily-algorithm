>recently,I find myself clumsy (╯`□′)╯(┻━┻.  
So I decide to do some practice to evoke my intellect.  
Ok,let's get it on~  

>ps:forgive my poor English plz :)

##day1

This algorithm is about to calculate the sum of a arithmetic progression  
without:"for","while","if","else","switch","case" and any else control  
statement.  

##day2

The problem is:  
There is a positive integer,I'm about to calculate the least steps  
to change it to 1.  
Step means:  
If this number is even number,just divide it by 2.This is ONE step.  
If this number is odd number,minus one or plus one.This is ONE step.  

##day3

The question is:
There is n balls and m baskets,I want to put the balls into the baskets.  
The algorithm returns the count of the distribution.  
ps:empty basket is allowed.  

##day4

The question is:  
There is a frog wants to jump to the top of the steps,the total number of  
the stairs is n(user input),and the frog can jump m(user input) stairs in  
one time.
How many ways can the frog reach the top?  

##day5

The question is:  
Calculate the preorder traverse of a binary tree according to the inorder  
traverse and the postorder traverse.(every node in the binary tree is different)  

##day6

Today,I want to learn something about sort algorithm,it's basic and absolutely important.  
The first sort I learn is merge sort.INTERESTING!~  

##day7

I learned insert sort,shell sort,select sort today,and also implement them in day6's code.  
I will implement all common sort methods in the near future.  

##day8

Today,I will realize the most useful sort algorithm:Heap sort & Quick sort!Quick sort is known  
as the top ten algorithm during the decade.EXCITING!~＞ω＜(code is merged in day6's project.)

##day9

The question is:  
 Input:a single linked list,a number k  
 Output:the value of No.k node in reverse order.(the last node is No.0 node in reverse order)  

##day10

The question is:  
Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome,considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.  
Number is not allowed.  
For example:  
 "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" is a palindrome.  
 "race a car" is not a palindrome.  

##day11

Given a non-empty array of integers, return the third maximum number in this array. If it does not exist,  
return the maximum number. The time complexity must be in O(n).  
 
Example 1:  
 Input: [3, 2, 1]  
 Output: 1  
 Explanation: The third maximum is 1.
 
Example 2:  
 Input: [1, 2]  
 Output: 2  
 Explanation: The third maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.

Example 3:  
 Input: [2, 2, 3, 1]  
 Output: 1  
 Explanation: Note that the third maximum here means the third maximum distinct number.  
 Both numbers with value 2 are both considered as second maximum.  

##day12

Here is the question:  
Compare two version numbers version1 and version2.  
If version1 > version2 return 1, if version1 < 
version2 return -1, otherwise return 0.  

You may assume that the version strings are non-empty and contain only digits and the . character.  
The . character does not represent a decimal point and is used to separate number sequences.  
For instance, 2.5 is not "two and a half" or "half way to version three", it is the fifth second-level  
revision of the second first-level revision.  

Here is an example of version numbers ordering:  
0.1 < 1.1 < 1.2 < 13.37  

##day13

The question is:  
The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag patternon a given number of rows like this:  
(you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)  
P A H N  
APLSIIG  
Y I R  
And then read line by line:  
"PAHNAPLSIIGYIR" Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:  
 
string convert(string text, int nRows);  
convert("PAYPALISHIRING", 3) should return "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR".
