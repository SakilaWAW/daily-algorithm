>recently,I find myself clumsy (╯`□′)╯(┻━┻.  
So I decide to do some practice to evoke my intellect.  
Ok,let's get it on~  

>ps:forgive my poor English plz :)

##day1

This algorithm is about to calculate the sum of a arithmetic progression  
without:"for","while","if","else","switch","case" and any else control  
statement.  

##day2

The problem is:  
There is a positive integer,I'm about to calculate the least steps  
to change it to 1.  
Step means:  
If this number is even number,just divide it by 2.This is ONE step.  
If this number is odd number,minus one or plus one.This is ONE step.  

##day3

The question is:
There is n balls and m baskets,I want to put the balls into the baskets.  
The algorithm returns the count of the distribution.  
ps:empty basket is allowed.  

##day4

The question is:  
There is a frog wants to jump to the top of the steps,the total number of  
the stairs is n(user input),and the frog can jump m(user input) stairs in  
one time.
How many ways can the frog reach the top?  

##day5

The question is:  
Calculate the preorder traverse of a binary tree according to the inorder  
traverse and the postorder traverse.(every node in the binary tree is different)
